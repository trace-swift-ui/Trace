## Updates
You can find our [logs page](https://trace.zip.log) to find out about our latest updates. 

## Pricing
Supporting iOS on browser for instant previews of your SwiftUI apps can get expensive. This is why we limit the access to our free plan. You can upgrade to the builder or the pro plan for unlimited access. See the [pricing page](https://www.trace.zip/pricing) for more info.
